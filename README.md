## The Data

This project used a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club
LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California.It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.

### Goal
Given historical data on loans given out to borrowers with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), the goal was to build a model that can predict wether or not a borrower will pay back their loan.

### Source
